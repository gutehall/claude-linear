name: code-review
description: >
  Performs a thorough, structured code review that goes beyond surface-level linting — it
  validates that the code actually works as intended, finds logic errors, missing edge cases,
  broken contracts between components, and anything that would cause the code to silently fail
  or behave incorrectly. If issues are found, the skill produces a concrete fix plan and then
  executes it, followed by test runs to confirm the fix holds. Use this skill for /review,
  ship-gate G3 on L/XL diffs, or when the user explicitly says "review this", "review my code",
  "check if this works", "does this look right", or "review before PR". Do not trigger
  proactively — only on these explicit calls.

# Code Review

**Goal**: Determine with confidence whether code does what it's supposed to — not just whether it looks clean, but whether it works correctly in all meaningful cases.

Four-phase protocol: **Understand → Audit → Plan & Fix → Verify**.

---

## Phase 1: Understand Intent

Before looking for problems, establish what "correct" means for this code.

**Gather:**
- What is this code supposed to do? (Read docstrings, comments, function names, call sites)
- What are the inputs and their valid ranges/types?
- What are expected outputs or side effects?
- What invariants must hold? (e.g. "this list is always sorted", "this value is never null")
- Broader context? (What calls this? What does it feed into?)

If intent unclear from code itself, ask user one targeted question before proceeding. Don't guess at intent — a "correct" review of the wrong spec is worthless.

---

## Phase 2: Audit — Does It Actually Work?

Go through code systematically. For each function, module, or logical unit, check:

### Correctness
- [ ] Does logic match stated intent?
- [ ] Off-by-one errors? (loop bounds, slice indices, pagination)
- [ ] Comparisons correct? (`>` vs `>=`, `===` vs `==`, wrong type comparisons)
- [ ] Mutable state modified correctly? (mutation when copy intended, or vice versa)
- [ ] Async operations awaited where needed? Unhandled promise rejections?
- [ ] Return values used correctly by callers?

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty inputs (empty array, empty string, zero, null/undefined)
- [ ] Single-element inputs
- [ ] Maximum/minimum values
- [ ] Concurrent access (if relevant)
- [ ] First/last items in collections

### Error Handling
- [ ] Errors caught at the right level?
- [ ] Do errors propagate so callers can act on them?
- [ ] Silent failures? (catching and swallowing exceptions, returning null instead of throwing)
- [ ] Cleanup done correctly on error paths?

### Data Flow
- [ ] Is data transformed correctly at each step?
- [ ] Implicit type coercions that could go wrong?
- [ ] Nullable/optional values checked before use?
- [ ] Correct data passed between functions (not stale, not mutated unexpectedly)?

### Dependencies and Contracts
- [ ] Does this code rely on behavior from external functions/APIs that may not hold?
- [ ] Implicit assumptions about the environment (env vars, file paths, network state)?
- [ ] Do interfaces between components match? (function signatures, API shapes, event payloads)

### Tests (if present)
- [ ] Do existing tests actually cover main logic paths?
- [ ] Tests for failure cases and edge cases?
- [ ] Do tests assert the right things, or just that nothing throws?
- [ ] Could a test pass even if the code is wrong?

---

## Phase 3: Report and Fix Plan

### If no issues found

State clearly: "This code appears correct. Here's what I verified: [brief summary]." Note anything worth flagging even if not a bug (fragile patterns, missing tests for edge cases).

### If issues found

One line per issue, format: `file:line — problem. fix.` Include severity and reproduction inline when it isn't obvious from "problem":

```
Issue #N: [Short title]
Severity: Critical | High | Medium | Low
Location: [file:line or function name]
Problem: [what's wrong — specific and mechanical, not vague]
Why it matters: [what goes wrong at runtime]
Reproduction: [minimal input/state demonstrating the bug]
Fix: [change that resolves the root cause]
```

Severity guide:
- **Critical** — data loss, security vulnerability, crash in normal use, or silently wrong results
- **High** — incorrect behavior in a common case or edge case likely hit in production
- **Medium** — incorrect in uncommon cases, or fragile to minor surrounding changes
- **Low** — not buggy now but fragile, misleading, or will cause bugs later

After listing all issues, produce a **Fix Plan** ordered by priority:
1. Fix immediately (Critical/High)
2. Fix before merge (Medium)
3. Note/defer (Low)

Ask: "Should I proceed with the fixes?" — unless user already said fix everything, then proceed directly.

---

## Phase 4: Apply Fixes

Fix one issue at a time. For each:

1. **State what's changing and why** (one sentence)
2. **Make the minimum change** resolving root cause
3. **Don't refactor unrelated things** — stay focused
4. **After each fix**, confirm briefly: "Fixed: [what changed]"

When all fixes applied, move to verification.

---

## Phase 5: Verify

After fixing, validate fixes work and nothing broke.

### Run existing tests first
```bash
# Run whatever test command is appropriate for this project:
# npm test / pytest / go test ./... / cargo test / etc.
```

Tests pass: good. Tests fail: apply diagnostic-thinking skill before touching anything else.

### Check fix coverage
For each Critical or High issue fixed:
- [ ] Existing test that would catch a regression?
- [ ] If not, write a minimal test demonstrating the fix works

Test structure:
```
Test name: [describes the scenario, not the implementation]
Setup: [minimal state to reproduce the original bug]
Action: [call the code]
Assert: [the correct output or behavior]
```

### Final run
Run full test suite once more after adding new tests. Report:
- Tests passing: N
- Tests added: N
- Issues resolved: N

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| What it looks like | Why it's a problem |
|---|---|
| Reviewing style instead of correctness | Doesn't tell you if code works |
| "This looks fine to me" without checking edge cases | Most common bugs live in edge cases |
| Fixing symptoms instead of root causes | Bug comes back in a different form |
| Multiple fixes in one change | You won't know which fix resolved which issue |
| Skipping verification | Fix may work for the wrong reason |
| Tests that only cover the happy path | False confidence |
| Not understanding intent before auditing | Can't tell if something's wrong without knowing "right" |

## `/review` Command

Invoked by `/review` command (`claude/commands/review.md`), installed same way as rest of package — see "Testing changes" in repo's CLAUDE.md.

**Usage:**
```
/review                        ← reviews whatever you're currently working on
/review src/auth/token.ts      ← reviews a specific file
/review the payment flow       ← reviews a feature area
/review before I open the PR   ← full review + fix + verify cycle
```

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before signing off on any review:

- [ ] Understand what this code is supposed to do?
- [ ] Checked edge cases: empty, null, single-item, boundary values?
- [ ] Checked error paths, not just happy path?
- [ ] Verified data flows correctly between components?
- [ ] Checked async operations handled correctly?
- [ ] Do existing tests prove correctness, or just that nothing explodes?
- [ ] If fixed something, verified with a test run?
- [ ] Every Critical/High issue fixed or explicitly deferred with a reason?
