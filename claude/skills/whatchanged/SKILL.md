# What Changed — Management Report

Produce a plain-language progress report for a non-technical audience. Lead with shipped value, not implementation detail. Persist a checkpoint so each run covers only the period since the last report.

## State file

Checkpoint lives at `.claude/whatchanged` in the project root (create `.claude/` if it doesn't exist).

File format (plain text, two lines):

```
timestamp=<ISO-8601 datetime>
commit=<full SHA>
```

Example:

```
timestamp=2026-05-01T14:32:00Z
commit=a3f9d12e8b1c4f7a0e2d5b6c9f3a8e1d4b7c0f2
```

## Step 1: Read the checkpoint

```
cat .claude/whatchanged 2>/dev/null
```

- File does **not** exist: first run. Print:

  > "No previous checkpoint found. Recording current state as the baseline — run `/whatchanged` again after your next batch of work to generate the first report."

  Then jump straight to **Step 5** (write the checkpoint and stop).

- File exists: parse `timestamp` and `commit` from it.

## Step 2: Gather data (run all in parallel)

Use `<timestamp>` as the time baseline for all sources and `<commit>` as the git baseline.

### Linear issues

Call `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__list_teams` to get the team ID, then `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__list_issues` filtered to `updatedAt` >= `<timestamp>`.

Categorise each issue:
- **Shipped**: status moved to Done or Cancelled within the period
- **In progress**: status is In Progress and was not Done at start of period
- **Started**: moved from Todo/Backlog to In Progress within the period

For each shipped issue, note the issue type if available (Feature, Bug, Improvement, etc.) — drives report grouping in Step 3.

Linear MCP unavailable: note "Linear data unavailable" and continue with git/GitHub data only.

### Merged PRs

```
gh pr list --state merged --json number,title,mergedAt,author,body --limit 50
```

Filter client-side to `mergedAt` > `<timestamp>`.

For each merged PR, check whether title or body contains a Linear issue ID (e.g. `FIN-42`, `Closes FIN-42`). PRs referencing a Linear issue are already covered by the Linear section — don't double-count. PRs with **no Linear issue reference** are untracked work done directly in Claude Code or outside the issue tracker.

`gh` unavailable: skip silently, note at the bottom.

### Untracked commits

```
git log <commit>..HEAD --oneline --no-merges
```

Identify commits not covered by any merged PR in the list above (not reachable from a merged PR's merge commit). Direct commits with no PR and no Linear issue.

`<commit>` no longer in history (e.g. after a rebase): fall back to `--since=<timestamp>`.

### Commit count (context only — not shown in body of report)

```
git log <commit>..HEAD --oneline --no-merges | wc -l
```

Used only in the footer line, not in the body.

## Step 3: Write the report

Plain language. Avoid technical jargon (no branch names, commit SHAs, file paths, or PR numbers in the body). Use issue titles as written in Linear — already the business description.

Use this format. Omit any section with no items.

```
## Progress Report: <start_date> → <end_date>

### Delivered
- <Issue title or synthesized description> — <one sentence plain-language description of the value delivered>
- ...

### Bug Fixes
- <Issue title or synthesized description>
- ...

### Other Work
- <synthesized description of untracked PR or commit>
- ...

### In Progress
- <Issue title> — started <N> days ago
- ...

### Coming Up (started this period)
- <Issue title>
- ...

---
<N> commits · <N> PRs merged · Period: <start_date> → <end_date>
```

**Writing the descriptions under Delivered:**
- Linear issues: pull description from the issue if it has one, otherwise infer from title
- Untracked PRs and commits: read PR title or commit messages, synthesize a plain-language summary of what changed
- One sentence maximum — what the user/customer can now do, or what improved, not what the engineer changed
- Example: "Users can now reset their password via email" not "Added POST /auth/reset endpoint"

**Grouping untracked work:**
- Place untracked PRs and direct commits under **Other Work** if unclear in nature
- PR title or commit messages clearly indicate a bug fix (`fix:`, `bug:`, resolved an error) → move to **Bug Fixes**
- Clearly indicate a user-facing feature or improvement → move to **Delivered**
- Use judgment — don't leave value out of the report just because it lacks a ticket

**Grouping tracked work:** Linear issue types available → split Delivered into sub-groups (Features, Improvements). Types not available → single Delivered list.

**Nothing changed:** print "No changes since `<start_date>`. Nothing to report." and still update the checkpoint.

## Step 4: Offer to share

After presenting the report, ask:

> "Want me to format this for Slack or email?"

- **Slack**: reformat as a compact message with emoji bullets, suitable for pasting into a channel update
- **Email**: wrap in a short intro line ("Here's a summary of what the team shipped this week:") and a closing line, plain text

Only reformat if user confirms.

## Step 5: Write the checkpoint

Always update the checkpoint at the end, even on first run or when nothing changed.

```
printf 'timestamp=%s\ncommit=%s\n' "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" > .claude/whatchanged
```

## Rules

- Write for a manager or stakeholder, not a developer — no SHAs, file names, or branch names in the report body
- Lead with shipped value; in-progress work is secondary context
- Never invent descriptions — derive them from the Linear issue title and description only
- Always update the checkpoint, even when nothing changed
- Do not create any Linear issues or PRs — read-only only
- State file corrupt or unparseable: treat as missing (first-run path)
