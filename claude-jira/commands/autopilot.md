# /autopilot - Allowlisted autonomous one-cycle: pick → implement → ship

`/grind`, but **hard-gated to issues labelled `auto-claude`**. Built for an unattended Claude Code instance: it may only ever touch work a human has explicitly opted in by adding the `auto-claude` label. Everything else is invisible to it.

```
/loop /autopilot project       # drain the allowlisted queue in an epic, one issue per cycle
/loop /autopilot issue          # one allowlisted issue per branch per cycle
```

Run bare (`/autopilot project`) to do exactly one cycle and stop.

> **Safety contract:** the automated instance is configured to run **only** `/autopilot` — never `/grind` or `/next`. `/autopilot` never reads, branches from, comments on, transitions, or implements any issue that does not carry the `auto-claude` label. If it ever picks up an issue without the label, it **stops the loop** rather than proceeding.

## Why this exists

`/grind` will pick up any issue in the ready queue. For an unsupervised instance that is too broad — a human must be able to decide, per issue, "yes, the bot may do this one." The `auto-claude` label is that switch.

## How it runs

**Follow `/grind` exactly** — same scope resolution, same cycle (pick → read → prior-work → branch → implement → ship-gate → ship → CI → transition + return to base), same loop control, same self-paced timing. Apply these deltas:

### 1. Queue filter (every issue query)

Add `-l"auto-claude"` to every `jira issue list` query in the pick step, in both scopes:

```bash
jira issue list --epics <epic-key> -s"To Do" -l"auto-claude" --plain          # project mode
jira issue list -s"To Do" -l"auto-claude" -a"$(jira me)" --plain               # issue mode
```

Never fall back to unlabelled issues, blocked issues, or other statuses/resolutions. Empty queue → **STOP LOOP** (clean finish):
`autopilot: no issues in "To Do" labelled auto-claude — <scope>. Stopping loop.`

### 2. Hard gate — verify the label after `jira issue view <key>`

Before doing anything else with the picked issue, confirm it actually carries the `auto-claude` label. If it does **not** (stale/unexpected filter result) → **STOP LOOP**, touch nothing further:
`autopilot: <key> is not labelled auto-claude — refusing to work it. Stopping loop.`

### 3. Skip actions keep the label

When `/grind` would move a skipped issue to Backlog (non-code, ambiguous, already-solved, in-flight), keep `auto-claude` in place so a human can re-queue it — add only `needs-human`:

```bash
jira issue move <key> "Backlog"
jira issue edit <key> --label needs-human --no-input
```

### 4. Merge — never direct-merge

An unattended instance never runs a direct `gh pr merge`. In `/grind` step 7, the only change:

- **Repo does not allow auto-merge (`--auto` rejected)** → **STOP LOOP**, leave the PR open, print `autopilot: cannot arm auto-merge on <PR> — review and merge manually. Stopping loop.` Never fall back to a direct merge.

Every other CI/merge branch (fail, no checks, armed-awaiting-approval, merged-immediately) is identical to `/grind`.

### 5. Receipts

All progress/stop lines are prefixed `autopilot:` instead of `grind:`. Success receipt:
```
autopilot ✓ PROJ-12 merged (PR #214). Next cycle.
```

## Stop conditions

Every `/grind` stop condition applies, plus:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No allowlisted (`auto-claude`) issues in To Do | STOP LOOP (clean finish) |
| Picked issue is missing the `auto-claude` label | STOP LOOP, touch nothing |
| Auto-merge not allowed by repo settings | STOP LOOP, PR left open — never direct-merge |

Never: prompt the user, work an issue without the `auto-claude` label, pick blocked work, guess work type, force-push, run a direct `gh pr merge`, or transition to Done before merge.
