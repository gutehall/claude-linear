# Duplicate Detection

Find issues describing same work, group into clusters, pick canonical issue per cluster, let user decide how to collapse each group. Never link or close anything without confirmation.

## Mindset

Two issues are duplicates when acting on one makes the other redundant — same bug, same feature, same fix. Don't flag issues that merely share a topic. Test: if you closed one, would the other still represent real outstanding work? If yes, they're related, not duplicate.

False positives waste user's time and risk losing tracked work. Bias toward precision — when unsure, label a pair "possible" rather than "duplicate" and let user judge.

## Loading the project

Use Atlassian MCP for rich reads, `jira` CLI for writes:

1. Atlassian MCP's issue-search tool (check available `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__*` tools for exact name) to pull issue set (or `jira issue list`)
2. Read titles, descriptions, and where useful, comments

By default compare **open work** (not yet Done/Closed). Honor flags widening the set:

| Flag | Set compared |
|------|--------------|
| (none) | open statuses (To Do, In Progress, etc.) |
| `--all` | every status including Done/Closed |
| `--project "<KEY>"` | only issues in that project |
| `--label <name>` | only issues carrying that label |

If set is large (>200), tell user the count and that comparison is title/description-based, then proceed.

## Cheap pre-filter before full comparison

Full pairwise semantic comparison is O(n²) — on 250 issues that's ~31k pairs, most of them obviously unrelated. Before running semantic judgment, bucket issues with cheap heuristics and only compare within a bucket:

- Same label(s), or
- Same epic/component, or
- Title shares at least one significant word (ignore stopwords like "fix", "add", "the")

Issues that share no bucket with anything are almost never duplicates — skip full comparison for them (they surface, if at all, as unclustered singletons; do not force a pairing). Within a bucket, apply the full semantic signal table below. This cuts the comparison set from all-pairs to same-bucket pairs, which is normally a small fraction on a real backlog.

If the workspace is small (<40 open issues), skip the pre-filter — the full O(n²) pass is cheap enough there and bucketing adds overhead for no savings.

## Detecting duplicates

Compare issues pairwise (within a bucket from the pre-filter above). Signals, strongest first:

| Signal | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Near-identical summary (same words, reordered or reworded) | High |
| Description describes same symptom, file, or feature | High |
| Same error message, stack trace, or reproduction steps | High |
| Same labels + same component + overlapping summary terms | Medium |
| One summary is a subset of another ("Fix login" vs "Fix login redirect bug") | Medium — may be epic/story, not duplicate |
| Shared topic only, different specifics | Low — usually NOT a duplicate |

Read summaries and descriptions semantically — "App crashes on logout" and "Logout throws null pointer" are the same bug despite no shared keywords. Conversely, "Add dark mode" and "Fix dark mode toggle" are different work.

Classify each pair/cluster by confidence:

- **Duplicate** — clearly same work. Safe to recommend collapsing.
- **Possible** — overlapping, needs a human call. Present, don't recommend.
- **Related** — same area but distinct work. Suggest linking, not collapsing.

## Picking the canonical issue

Within a duplicate cluster, canonical is the one to keep. Prefer, in order:

1. Most complete — real description, acceptance criteria, story points
2. Most activity — comments, assignee, in-progress status, linked PR/branch
3. Oldest — the original, if above tie

Everything else in cluster collapses into canonical.

## Presenting clusters

Group findings by confidence, most actionable first. Be specific — keys and summaries, not counts alone:

```
Duplicates (2 clusters)

  Cluster A — keep PROJ-12
    PROJ-12  "Login redirect loops on expired session"   (has description, assignee, in progress)
    PROJ-47  "Infinite redirect when token expired"        (no description, backlog)
    → same bug. Recommend: close PROJ-47 as duplicate, link to PROJ-12.

  Cluster B — keep PROJ-3
    PROJ-3   "Add CSV export to billing"
    PROJ-29  "Export invoices as CSV"
    → same feature. Recommend: collapse PROJ-29 into PROJ-3.

Possible (1 cluster) — needs your call
    PROJ-8   "Dashboard slow to load"
    PROJ-31  "Optimize dashboard queries"
    → PROJ-31 may be the fix for PROJ-8, or a separate task.

Related (linking only)
    PROJ-5 / PROJ-19 — both touch auth, different work. Offer to link as related.
```

## Acting on a cluster

Jira has native **Duplicate** link type and transitions, so collapsing is clean. Offer these actions per cluster, apply only confirmed one:

**1. Collapse (link + close duplicate, keep canonical)** — default for clear duplicates:
- Copy any context duplicate has that canonical lacks: `jira issue comment add PROJ-12 "..."` or edit canonical's description.
- Link duplicate to canonical: `jira issue link PROJ-47 PROJ-12 "Duplicate"`
- Comment on duplicate: `jira issue comment add PROJ-47 "Duplicate of PROJ-12. Collapsed via /dedupe."`
- Close duplicate: `jira issue move PROJ-47 "Done"` (or your workflow's "Won't Do"/"Closed" status; set resolution Duplicate if workflow supports it).

**2. Link only (related, not duplicate):**
- `jira issue link PROJ-5 PROJ-19 "relates to"` — keep both open.

**3. Skip** — leave cluster untouched.

Avoid `jira issue delete` — destructive and irreversible. Closing as duplicate preserves history and audit trail.

Present per cluster:

```
Cluster A — keep PROJ-12, collapse PROJ-47
[Enter] Collapse (link + close PROJ-47 as duplicate of PROJ-12)
[l] Link as related only   [s] Skip   [q] Quit
```

## Output

After all clusters:

```
Reviewed N clusters. Collapsed M, linked L, skipped S.
```

List each collapse as `PROJ-47 → PROJ-12`.

## Error handling

- `jira` link/comment/move fails: print error, offer retry or skip — never silently continue, never close a duplicate without its link + cross-link comment first.
- Transition name invalid: run `jira issue move PROJ-47 --help` to find valid target status for workflow, then retry.
- MCP/CLI unreachable: report it and stop.
- Canonical pick ambiguous (true tie): present cluster, ask which to keep before acting.

## Rules

- Never link, close, or modify an issue without explicit confirmation for that cluster.
- Always preserve context — copy useful description/comments into canonical before closing a duplicate.
- Never use `jira issue delete`. Closing as duplicate is strongest action this skill takes, and it's reversible.
- Always create Duplicate link before closing, so closed issue points to its survivor.
- Bias toward "possible" over "duplicate" when uncertain — let human decide.
